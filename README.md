## My process

### Built with

- Vue
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Leafletjs
### What I learned
I used to be unfamiliar with using map in Vue, but this project is a breakthrough for me.
After researching, I found that using the composable approach to implement maps can separate the map logic from the display logic, which is quite convenient.
